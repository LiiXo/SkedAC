# Anti Cheat Control Recorder

Intended for the competition site https://sked.gg/.

This program allows referees to consult the views of their players by request of the opposing team.

This program uses the library: Ffmpeg.

It generates the clip, compresses it into a .zip file and then adds a password so that the referees and no one else can view the gameplay.
